UDACITY - Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program 2018
Project 6 - News App
News feed app from The Guardian site.
The app connects to the Internet to provide news articles on the particular topic "Books".

The app display the last 30 articles about books from The Guardian page, newest article first. I tried the list to look nice in landscape 
and portrait mode.
Clicking on a book article uses an intent to open the article in the userâ€™s browser.

I followed the project rubric and I added one extra feature: display the image thumbnail of the news article in articles list. 
Yes, I know the project rubric say images are not required but I was very curious how to do this. Finaly I found a very simple way, 
using Picasso (only one statement). 
I could use Picasso external libraries for this because it is an extra feature not a core functionality from ptoject rubric. 


UDACITY reviewer's notes:

Meets Specifications
Congratulations on completing your project.
I can see that the user interface is just amazing and the code quality is brilliant. 
It seems like you already have too much experience at this stage.
You did a great job!
